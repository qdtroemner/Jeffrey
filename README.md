# Welcome to the Jeffrey bot source code!
> Current verision: v1.0

# Usage
In its current form, the Jeffrey bot can be run through `bot.py` in the `src` folder.
The only missing file is `secrets.py` which you should add to `src/reqs/` and create a variable named `TOKEN` with your bot token.
The docs for [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) can be found [here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html).

Feel free to use or copy this code.
